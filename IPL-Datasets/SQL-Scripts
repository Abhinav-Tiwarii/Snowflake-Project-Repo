--We will load data from external source to our snowflake to the stage layer.
So, for this, We will create one stage layer in snowflake.

Database: ABHI_PRAC
Schema: SQL_PROJECT_PRAC
Stage: SQL_PROJECT_PRAC_STG
Table: IPL_MATCH
       IPL_BALLS
FILE_FORMAT: CSV_FILE_FORMAT

Load data from External Source into Stage Layer of Snowflake. 
From Stage layer, we will load our data into tables via Copy into Command. 
Before that, we will have to create one file_format object.
And Once our data is available in tables, we will start our querying into it.
